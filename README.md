# Hotel Reservation System

## Introduction
This is the final project in my Java class. 

Hotel ABC, located in XYZ city, previously used a **manual reservation and billing system**, which caused inefficiencies and risks such as lost records, extra storage requirements, and human errors in billing.  

This project implements a **computerized Hotel Reservation System** that allows hotel staff to quickly manage reservations, maintain secure records, and provide a smooth booking and billing experience for guests.

## Objectives
- Replace the manual reservation system with a computerized solution.
- Save time for hotel employees and guests.
- Develop data structures to store guest details efficiently.
- Create a user-friendly interface for both guests and staff.
- Allow guests to book rooms via **kiosk** or **phone**.
- Provide automatic billing at check-out.

## Functional Requirements

### Guest Booking (Kiosk/Self-service)
- Welcome page with a friendly message.
- Display available rooms read from the database.
- Ask for the number of guests and suggest the required number of rooms.
- Limit of 2 adults per room; allow single-person bookings.
- Collect guest details with proper validation.
- Record check-in/check-out dates.
- Confirm booking and store information in the database.
- Show confirmation and welcome message to the guest.

### Guest Booking (Phone/Staff-assisted)
- Admin login page for staff only.
- Collect guest information and booking details similar to kiosk process.

### Admin Functions
